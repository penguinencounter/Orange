Installing Orange3

Orange3 is written in python and comes with the anaconda distribution
of python.  It is completely free.

1) Download anaconda 2020.07 with python 3.8.

   The basic info about anaconda is at
  
     https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

   and download links are at the bottom of the page
  
    Windows: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Windows-x86_64.exe
    Mac:     https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
    Linux:   https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
	 
2) Anaconda Windows Install

   https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

   Double click on Anaconda3-2020.07-Windows-x86_64.exe.
   Click on "Run"
   Click on "Next"
   Click on "I Agree"
   Choose "Just Me"   [If you choose "All users" you will get 
                       permission issues when you try to install Orange3]
   Click on "Next"
   Change the path if you want.
   Click on "Next"
   Advanced Installation Options: go with the defaults
   Click "Install"
   Click "Next"
   I tend to unclick both tutorial and "learn more"
   Click "Finish"
      
3) Anaconda Linux Install   

   https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

   $ bash Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
   
   and follow your nose.  It does need to be bash.  
   
4) Anaconda Mac Install

   https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

   I have never done it.  Being mac, I would hope it is easy.
   
5) Run Anaconda Navagator

   For windows, there is a shortcut in the start menu => Anaconda 3
   (64-bit) => Anaconda Navagator.
   
   For Linux, it is in the same bin directory as python

    $ anaconda-navagator    
	
   For mac, don't know.  I assume it is obvious.

   The first time you run navagator, it does some initialization.
   Future launches will be faster.

6) Orange3 Install. 

   In Anaconda Navagator, find the Organe3 3.26.0 Tile and click "Install".
      
   For conda pros, you can also use the conda command line 

     $ conda install -c conda-forge orange3

7) Run Orange3

   The "install" box in orange3 tile should not be a "run" box.  Click
   it.
